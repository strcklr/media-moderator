# Frontend

The frontend for this project is written in JavaScript and uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

## Requirements

You will need some sort of runtime to execute the code. I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once installed and the repository is clonded, navigate to the directory with the package.json and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

A /node_modules directory should be created at the same level in your project, containing all the required node modules.

## Usage

To run the app, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then, navigate to the localhost port that the application is running on. Typically, this is localhost:3000, but may vary.
