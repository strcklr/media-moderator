# mp4-content-moderator
This project aims to use create software that will scrub an mp4 to determine if the video contains anything NSFW or that would violate YouTube/Twitch TOS. The goal of this project will be to introduce myself to entry level cloud tasks (creating ec2 instances using Docker, developing plans using Terraform, etc.).
