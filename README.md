This project will scrub an mp4 to determine if the video contains anything NSFW or that would violate YouTube/Twitch TOS. 

The goal of this project will be to introduce myself to entry level cloud tasks (creating ec2 instances using Docker, developing plans using Terraform, etc.) as well as familiarize myself with common machine learning paradigms.
